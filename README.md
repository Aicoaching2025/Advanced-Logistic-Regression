## Project Overview

In scenarios like credit risk prediction or fraud detection, the assumptions behind logistic regression, the choice of prediction threshold, and dealing with imbalanced classes are critical. This project:
- Evaluates the assumptions of logistic regression.
- Investigates the effect of varying prediction thresholds.
- Uses ROC curves to analyze model performance.
- Implements strategies to address class imbalance, ensuring reliable predictions.

## Data Generation & Scenario

- **Synthetic Data Creation:**  
  Data is generated to simulate a binary classification problem with an imbalanced target variable (e.g., 90% low risk vs. 10% high risk).
- **Financial Context:**  
  This scenario mirrors real-world financial applications where adverse events (defaults, fraud) are rare but critical.

## Modeling Considerations

### Assumptions Behind Logistic Regression
- **Linearity:**  
  Assumes a linear relationship between the log-odds and predictor variables.
- **Independence:**  
  Observations are assumed to be independent of one another.
- **No Perfect Multicollinearity:**  
  Predictor variables should not be perfectly correlated.

### Prediction Thresholds
- **Default Threshold:**  
  Typically 0.5, but may not be optimal in imbalanced settings.
- **Threshold Tuning:**  
  Adjusting the threshold can help optimize sensitivity (recall) or specificity based on business needs.

### ROC Curves
- **Performance Analysis:**  
  The ROC curve illustrates the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate at various threshold settings.
- **AUC Metric:**  
  The area under the ROC curve (AUC) provides a single metric to evaluate model discrimination ability.

### Addressing Class Imbalance
- **Resampling Techniques:**  
  Over-sampling the minority class or under-sampling the majority class to balance the dataset.
- **Class Weighting:**  
  Adjusting the weights of classes in the logistic regression model to penalize misclassification of the minority class more heavily.

## Visualizations & Evaluation

- **ROC Curve Plot:**  
  Displays model performance across various thresholds.
- **Confusion Matrix & Precision-Recall:**  
  Visualizes classification performance and helps in selecting an optimal threshold.
- **Threshold Analysis Graphs:**  
  Show the effect of different thresholds on sensitivity and specificity.

## Actionable Insights

1. **Optimizing Risk Prediction:**  
   - Adjusting the prediction threshold can significantly improve the detection of high-risk cases while managing false positives.
2. **Balancing Trade-offs:**  
   - ROC and precision-recall analyses provide a clear picture of trade-offs, informing strategies to mitigate risk.
3. **Improved Decision-Making:**  
   - By addressing class imbalance, the model becomes more robust, leading to better-informed financial risk assessments.
4. **Tailored Strategies:**  
   - Insights from threshold tuning can guide personalized risk management, such as varying loan terms or targeted fraud prevention measures.
